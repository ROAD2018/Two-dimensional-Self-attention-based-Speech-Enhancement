
Two-dimensional self-attention-based speech enhancement

The speech stored in this git is enhanced by our 2D-SA. 
We evaluate the performance on two datasets.
(1) An open-source dataset [1].
(2) A large-scale dataset (Designed and generated by ourselves). 

In this Git, enhanced speech, models, and the enhanced edges are uploaded.
